# Installation

----

## Stable release

To install PyAuxLib, run this command in your terminal:

=== ":simple-poetry: Poetry (recommended)"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    poetry add pyauxlib
    ```

    If you donâ€™t have [Poetry] installed, you can refer to the following instructions for [Poetry installation].

=== "pip"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    pip install pyauxlib
    ```

    If you don't have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can guide
    you through the process.

These are the preferred methods to install PyAuxLib, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

## From sources

The sources for PyAuxLib can be downloaded from the [Github repo].

You can either clone the public repository or download the [tarball].

=== "Cloning"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    git clone git://github.com/psolsfer/pyauxlib
    ```

=== "Tarball"

    ```bash linenums="0"
    curl -OJL https://github.com/psolsfer/pyauxlib/tarball/main
    ```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash linenums="0"
cd pyauxlib
poetry install
```

This command installs all dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml` and also creates a virtual environment if one doesn't exist.
